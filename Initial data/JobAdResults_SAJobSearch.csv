What we do at Codat:

Our mission is to make life easier for the lifeblood of economies globally; small and medium-
sized businesses. Codat is a universal API for consented business financial data, powering the 
next generation of products and services for this historically underserved market. 

We have offices in London and New York, and a San Francisco office will be opening soon. Codat 
Limited is a privately held company, we’ve raised more than $50 million in investment from 
Index Ventures, Tiger Global, American Express and Paypal. We were also awarded £7.5m in 
grants from the RBS Capability and Innovation Fund to help power our growth.

We live by our values of being united as a single team, building a product that is useful to our 
clients and their customers alike, with a focus and urgency that makes us unstoppable.

What you will be doing:
While Codat has already had success in signing a number of accounts in the region, this is a 
truly exciting opportunity for the right candidate to help build and close an existing pipeline of 
prospective clients in APAC.

You will be joining a newly launched team in Sydney, Australia and alongside the APAC 
Commercial Director you will be instrumental in building a high performing team culture in the 
region. You will have responsibility for the end-to-end sales process for clients in Australia and 
other parts of APAC using Codat's API infrastructure to power lending, ecommerce, payments 
and FX solutions for small businesses.

Your focus will be on generating new business from a range of businesses, from exciting fintechs
to large enterprises across a number of industries and sectors. You will be a true self starter, 
just as comfortable in cold prospecting activities and building a pipeline as you are closing large 
strategic accounts. 

As one of the first sales members in the region, you will be expected to be involved in all parts 
of the sales process and while you will be initially supported by a team of Business Development
Reps in the UK but unlike other Account Executives, you will be responsible for understanding 
and selling across the full suite of Codat’s use cases. 

Codat has a proven track record supporting eCommerce and payments companies around the 
world and we are looking to rapidly expand on our strong base of existing clients by hiring 
someone with expertise in this space.

No matter what we’re doing - whether we’re speaking to customers, partners or to each other - 
we live by our values.

We believe in delivering useful technology that solves real problems for real businesses. We 
have a real want to do the stuff that isn't always “cool” but makes a difference.
We believe that the people in the best teams push and enable each other to excel. We’re 
united when we have each other’s backs - when something goes wrong, we don’t blame, we 
work together to fix it. We embrace differences of opinion to end up with better outcomes. 
Transparency in our interactions is critical to drive towards our goals as a team. We openly 
share all information with all colleagues by default, unless we have a really good reason not to. 
We embrace differences of opinion to end up with better outcomes. We don’t let our egos win.
We believe that an unstoppable drive towards a single, clearly stated goal is the best way to 
build great things. We are biased towards action - we make informed decisions and then we 
act. We inspect and question the status quo with curiosity, unafraid to ask the hard questions. 

There is no such thing as an impossible problem, just a great challenge to sink our teeth into.

What excites us
5+ years of quota carrying experience and evidence of high performance
Experience in financial services or selling to financial service providers
Experience working for a start-up or scale-up
Strong prospecting, qualifying, and negotiating skills
Strong executive and sales presence
Good understanding of Codat and our clients’ products
An existing network in the region 

If you are excited about applying for this role but aren't certain you meet 100% of the criteria, 
we'd still love to hear from you

You will engage in research ranging from new technologies and trends to the development of future economic scenarios and models.
You will be helping clients interpret and understand methodologies and solutions applied to organisational design, future scenarios, and technology roadmaps.
You will assist both internal and external clients in understanding how to implement recommendations.
You will manage, analyse, and present data (primarily excel based). Quantitative and qualitative analysis will come through life through your visualisations.
Collaborate with internal teams to create, develop, and bring to life new features or products and continue to shape Faethm’s evolution.
You will build strong stakeholder relationships across the organisation and effectively communicate technical and complex concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
 
To be successful in this role, ideally, you will have:

An MBA or other advanced business or analytics degree
3-6 years of consulting experience across workforce transformation
Prior consulting experience has included working with human resource data and projects in strategic workforce planning, economic scenario modelling and technology maturity assessment
Knowledge and interest in emerging technologies

Ability to navigate complexity and ambiguity
Flexibility, openness to new things and ability to propose innovative ideas
Ability to work in a growing and dynamic environment with integrity and a sense of humour
 
Join Faethm and you will: Work for an inventive, purpose-driven and civic-minded company with an ambitious but realisable mission and vision that tackles a very real and globally important issue. People are our secret sauce. So what are you waiting for? Come and work with an amazing team of professionals, in an autonomous, agile, yet supportive and flexible environment.

* Ability to independently scope and run multiple, concurrent project independently.

It would also be nice if your background included:

* Knowledge of APNIC (or the Asia Pacific region) is a big plus

Team and cultural fit are equally as important to us as your professional know-how, so you should demonstrate: 

* High-level capacity for adaptability, flexibility and commitment, and the ability to apply sound judgment and reasoning, particularly when under pressure
* Ability to establish and maintain effective relationships across all levels of the organisation
* Strong self-management skills

	 A willingness to investigate and learn new products and services; 
	 Loves learning and sharing their knowledge with the team.

You will work together across customer insights, product, and data science teams to provide knowledge assets, analysis, and expert advisory to internal and external clients.

You will engage in research ranging from new technologies and trends to the development of future economic scenarios and models.
You will be helping clients interpret and understand methodologies and solutions applied to organisational design, future scenarios, and technology roadmaps.
You will assist both internal and external clients in understanding how to implement recommendations.
You will manage, analyse, and present data (primarily excel based). Quantitative and qualitative analysis will come through life through your visualisations.
Collaborate with internal teams to create, develop, and bring to life new features or products and continue to shape Faethm’s evolution.
You will build strong stakeholder relationships across the organisation and effectively communicate technical and complex concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
 
To be successful in this role, ideally, you will have:

An MBA or other advanced business or analytics degree
3-6 years of consulting experience across workforce transformation
Prior consulting experience has included working with human resource data and projects in strategic workforce planning, economic scenario modelling and technology maturity assessment
Knowledge and interest in emerging technologies
Exceptional time management and presentation skills, as well as analytical, problem-solving, and research skills
Outstanding interpersonal and communication skills, written and verbal
Ability to navigate complexity and ambiguity
Flexibility, openness to new things and ability to propose innovative ideas
Ability to work in a growing and dynamic environment with integrity and a sense of humour
 
Join Faethm and you will: Work for an inventive, purpose-driven and civic-minded company with an ambitious but realisable mission and vision that tackles a very real and globally important issue.

We’re looking for a Campaign Manager to join the Fair Agenda team!
Fair Agenda is a growing community of 43,000 campaigning for a future where we can all live with safety, security and agency over our lives and bodies – no matter our gender. 

We are seeking an experienced campaigner and strategist to join our team as a Campaign Manager. The successful applicant will drive campaigns to address gendered violence, mobilise tens of thousands of Australians for justice, and help persuade political, corporate and community decision-makers to implement policies for a more fair, gender equal and safe future.
They will join a small but mighty team and drive campaigning in a nimble, impact-focused and multi-issue organisation, with a strong focus on issues of gendered violence. 

THE DETAILS

Loading: We are seeking expression of interest in an ongoing role, which is available on a 0.8 - 1 FTE basis. 

Location: Fair Agenda has desk space in Melbourne, but we have team members working remotely in Melbourne and NSW; and we welcome expressions of interest from candidates willing to work remotely from other parts of the country.

Flexible work: We provide flexible work options, including remote work, and flexible start/finish times. 

Leave: We care about the wellbeing of team members, and offer 14 days personal leave pro rata, as well as 18 weeks paid parental leave, paid domestic and family violence leave, cultural and ceremonial leave and gender affirmation leave. 

Salary: The indicative salary range for the role is $92,000 - $96,000 per annum, pro rata. Starting salary and salary increases will be determined in line with a matrix for the role. The matrix and assessment will be made available for discussion and transparency, and the successful applicant will have an opportunity to review and feedback on that matrix before the starting salary is set. 


ABOUT FAIR AGENDA

We leverage rapid online, social and media campaigning tactics to put issues of gender inequity on the agenda for decision-makers. We deliver our campaigns in partnership with service providers, policy experts, and people with lived experience to change the policies that change women’s lives. 

To date our campaigning has positively impacted the lives of over 1 million women in Australia, including:
* Breaking the story on the Government’s harmful respectful relationships content, namely the ‘Milkshake Consent’ video, in partnership with End Rape on Campus Australia
* An additional $150 million of federal funding to improve responses to family and domestic violence, 
* The decriminalisation of abortion in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia,
* Blocking cuts to working parents’ time to care for their newborns that would have hurt 79,000 working families a year, 
* Working with partner organisations and survivor advocates to help stop $34 million of scheduled cuts to Community legal Centres, which would have hurt tens of thousands of women affected by family violence, and
* Securing $4 million of additional funding for domestic violence hotline 1800 RESPECT to ensure thousands of women’s calls weren’t left unanswered.

We anticipate our campaign priorities as an organisation over the next six months include (but are not limited to): 
* Securing action for a safer parliament, through implementation of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner’s Set the Standard recommendations,
* Improving the prevention of gender based violence - including through proper funding of expert-led respectful relationships education.
* Improving legal and institutional responses to survivors of gendered violence - which could include work to expand the pathways for response from carceral focused responses,

About the Campaign Manager role
The Campaign Manager will develop and drive strategies on new and existing Fair Agenda campaigns, including those with a focus on improving legal responses to sexual and domestic violence. 
The Campaign Manager will be responsible for managing some campaigns from start to finish; contributing to campaigns across the organisation; and will deliver tactics to mobilise tens of thousands of Australians, and persuade political, corporate and community decision makers to improve the policies that shape our lives.
The Campaign Manager will work closely with colleagues (Executive Director, Senior Campaigner and another Campaign Manager) and partner organisations to develop campaigns and innovate tactics to influence change.


Specifically, the Campaign Manager will be responsible for:
* Managing the planning and delivery of a number of campaigns, 
* Developing and delivering a broad range of tactics to win campaigns, 
* Maintaining stakeholder relationships,
* Developing and executing rapid response campaigns,
* Engaging Fair Agenda members with campaigns and actions, including:
* Supporting and training Fair Agenda members to participate in or lead campaign activities,
* Developing video and visual content to engage members with campaigns,
* Writing and editing action emails to Fair Agenda members,
* Contributing to fundraising for the organisation, including:
* Developing and delivering tactics for member fundraising, 
* Maintaining relationships with some mid-tier donors (with support from the Executive Director),
* Testing new approaches to grow the impact and size of the Fair Agenda community,
* Developing media strategies, writing press releases, pitching stories and organising media actions, including acting as a media spokesperson,
* Fostering productive working relationships amongst the team, and applying organisational values to the work,
* Other ad hoc activities as discussed with the Executive Director.

As the Campaign Manager your week might involve things like: 
Managing a media response to a development in your campaign area,
Conceptualising and developing video or visual content to engage members with an issue on social media,
Writing and editing action emails to Fair Agenda members,
Running a huddle with colleagues to brainstorm a response to a Government announcement,
Deep diving on data analysis to understand opportunities to improve Fair Agenda’s performance in different areas, and making recommendations for changes,
Jumping on the phone to identify opportunities for intervention with a collaborating organisation.

The Centre aims at building workforce capacity in Australian organisations to create, protect and sustain agile data pipelines which are capable of detecting and responding to failures and risks across the information value chain in which the data is sourced, shared, transformed, analysed, and consumed. This research is funded in partnership with IP Australia, with the aim to create a pathway for automated knowledge mining from scientific articles and invention patents. Many pre-existing technologies can be identified via patent documents and academic research papers, a process that is sometimes referred to as ‘horizon scanning’ or ‘technology landscaping’. This project aims to develop a novel AI-driven approach to technology landscaping based on patents and academics. The new approach will support the strategic positioning of firms and research groups by enabling an insight into the landscape of pre-existing technologies relevant to their proposed innovations. This research will provide insight into areas where gaps in the current technology landscape exist, thus identifying promising future areas of potential innovation. This project will involve the application of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to identify patents and research papers that are semantically similar to a given query document, as well as topic modelling to identify technology gaps.This PhD scholarship is based at Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, and will also include a placement with government partner organisation IP Australia.

Health Care
The Medicare system in Australia provides access to a wide range of health care services, free medical care in public hospitals and lower costs for prescription medicines. Certain categories of visitors, all Australian citizens and all eligible Australian residents can access these services after enrolling in Medicare.
Education 
The Australian public education system has a good reputation for its high quality of students and learning methodologies – it must be noted that academic results are not the only factor that the Australian education system teaches, with equal emphasis on how students interact, learn, do in sports etc. It is a more holistic based system.
Weather and Climate
Australia is also an attractive migration destination because of its temperate weather on most of the East coast. All four season can be found on the Australian east coast region, with the full experience of living through the blue skies of summer and spring as well as the coolness and crispness of winter and autumn.
World's most liveable cities
The Economist runs a survey every year in order to rank the most liveable cities in the world. According to these surveys, multiple Australian cities made it every year on the list of the best cities to live in the world. 
The Coffee Culture
Do you love your coffee? If you do, then Australia can be considered a coffee nirvana. Australia is known for its coffee culture – everyone drinks coffee here. There are coffee shops all over the major cities, grinding fresh beans for your coffee fix. Migrants moving from countries with a similar coffee culture have one more reason to like Australia.

The Food
The food is great in Australia, with multiple Michelin star restaurants, fast food chains, cafes and restaurants of every kind. Because of the large migrant population across the country you can enjoy very diverse food options, from authentic Vietnamese to Italian and Chinese food, all being made with freshest ingredients farmed predominantly in Australia.

Pathway to citizenship
All permanent residents can eventually qualify to become an Australian citizen. A big advantage for migrants moving to the country is the fact that Australia recognises dual citizenship and that children born to permanent residents in Australia can apply for citizenship even if their parents don’t yet qualify.

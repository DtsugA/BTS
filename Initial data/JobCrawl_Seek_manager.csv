However, not all introduced species establish widely or necessarily do much harm in their new location but changing climates can also mean even initially benign species start to spread further and/or have greater impacts.One recently introduced species in South Australia is the pearl oyster (Pinctada albina sugillata), a tropical species that appears to have invaded large areas of subtidal and intertidal habitats of the Upper Spencer Gulf, South Australia. Spencer Gulf is one of the world’s largest inverse estuaries and supports important fisheries, aquaculture, tourism and a range of other coastal industries.Ten years ago, locals around the northern parts of the Spencer Gulf started reporting the oyster becoming abundant and attaching to (and potentially smothering) native bivalve shellfish such as razorfish, but the impact of the introduced oysters is not clear, nor is whether they are continuing to spread (or how far they might go). This project will assess the ecology of pearl oysters as they establish in the gulfs in South Australia and the impact this is having on this unique marine ecosystem.You will join a strong and dynamic research group focussed on human impacts in the marine environment.  We have established connections with government and industry in the Upper Spencer Gulf and work on environmental issues in collaboration with the Environment Protection Agency, Department of Environment and Water, SA Water, regional councils, Northern and Yorke Landscape Management Board, as well as port authorities and resources companies.You will have access to the Future Industries Institute which brings together UniSA’s world-class strengths in advanced manufacturing, nanomedicine, minerals and resource engineering, and environmental science, and hosts a substantial number of postgraduate students, as well as a range of advanced analytical equipment that might be used in this research.What you’ll doIn this project-based research degree, you will be involved in intertidal and boating field work in the Upper Spencer Gulf, including overnight trips. Some periods of field work are likely to run out of UniSA’s Whyalla campus in the Upper Spencer Gulf. The project will help you develop skills in designing and running environmental surveys and manipulative field experiments, analysing ecological data, and conducting risk assessments for biosecurity.  You will have unparalleled access to vehicles, vessels, remotely operated vehicles (ROV) and other field equipment necessary for this project. Collaborating with Biosecurity SA and research scientists from Aquatic Sciences at the South Australian Research and Development Institute on this project you will gain understanding/experience in translating research outcomes into policy decisions and start building your industry and professional networks.Where you’ll be basedYou will be based in UniSA STEM. We link engineering, mathematics, science, defence, cybersecurity, construction management, environmental science, aviation, information management, information technology, and project management, harnessing the connections across disciplines to bring big ideas to fruition.Our researchers deliver technical expertise and advice to industry, government and community groups to make commercially viable and sustainable impacts. The Future Industries Institute, Innovation and Collaboration Centre, and Australian Research Centre for Interactive and Virtual Environments all provide consultancy and access to advanced technology.In an information-rich world, our people think big, combatting problems, testing solutions and making data-driven decisions.

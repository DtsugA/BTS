The Buyer Abuse Engineering Team, a group within BRP, strives to protect Amazon businesses exposed to customer abuse while maintaining the highest level of customer experience for our good customers. This means building highly sophisticated, data-centric systems that can detect abusive patterns across millions of transactions. We build highly scalable, flexible and distributed systems that utilize the power of data at every step - compute predictive variables, build models using machine learning algorithms and plug into different pipelines to prevent abusive transactions from taking place. As Amazon businesses grow and abusers morph to find new ways to take undue advantage of our liberal policies, our engineers and data scientists are constantly innovating to stay ahead of the game and protect Amazon and our customers. Key job responsibilitiesWe are looking for top-notch engineers to round out this effort and lay the technical foundations for a mature program.
